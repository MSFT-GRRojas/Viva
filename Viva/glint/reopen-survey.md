# Reopen a recently closed Viva Glint survey

## Reopen a survey window for a recently closed survey

Sometimes survey takers may need extra time to complete a survey or your response rate may not be as high as you hoped. Admins can reopen a survey as long as a new cycle hasn't started. For best results, reopen a recently closed survey within a day or two of the survey cycle ending.  

Procedure:

1. Select the **Configuration** symbol on your admin dashboard (landing page).
2. Select **Survey Programs**.
3. In the **Survey Cycles** section, toggle to the **Completed** tab.
4. Using the horizontal elipses (overflow menu) next to the survey you wish to reopen, choose **Reopen Survey**.

5. A **Reopen Survey Cycle** window opens. Consider the following before moving on:
   - Notification emails about this survey's close date and Team Conversatiosn are rescheduled based on the new close date. If you prefer, disable all future notification emails about this survey cycle. 
   - The *Phased Access* user role no longer can access the results of this survey in the Reporting dashboard until the role is granted access again.  
   - The Team Conversations for this survey is deleted and regenerated after the survey closes on the new date. It's not available while the survey is reopened.
   - Review any scheduled Nudges. They aren't rescheduled automatically. 
6. Select a new close date for this survey.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A survey extension can't close past the start date of the next scheduled survey. If you choose an invalid date, you see a message directing you to choose a different date.

7. Select **Save**. When saved, the survey is immediately reopened and closes at midnight (11:59PM) of the selected date in the client's time zone and should now show **Live** status.
8. On the **Communications** tab in Program Summary, reschedule all survey end conversation notification emails based on the new close date.
