# Manage language translations in Viva Glint programs 

English is the default language for all Microsoft Viva Glint programs, but admins can send surveys and email communications to employees in their preferred language. Glint provides customers with about 70 language translations for standard program content. Language translations are set during the initial survey configuration or added later as needed. Use Viva Glint's export/import option to review,â€¯add, or edit translations for survey emails and content (items, responses, survey text). 

There are four steps for language translations: 

1. Export content from the Viva Glint program into a *.csv* or *.xlsx* file 
2. Translate content 
3. Review translations 
4. Import content back into the Viva Glint program

> [!TIP]
> Find valid language codes for Viva Glint on the Language Codes tab of the Viva Glint [Employee Attribute Template](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105533).

## Export survey and email text 

Follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to the appropriate survey program. 
2. From the Actions dropdown menu and, select **Export Program Content**. 
3. Choose to export email content, survey content, or both.  
4. Select the languages you would like to export from the **Languages to include** section. Options in this menu are based on the default and other languages selected for the survey program.
5. Select **Generate CSV**. 
6. From the file generated, make translations to import back into Viva Glint. 

>[!NOTE]
> The email content will be downloaded as its own separate document. Survey content downloads as a zip file with one file containing survey questions and text snippets.

>[!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint system requires that one language document is initially exported and then later imported back into the program before the process can be repeated for other languages.
