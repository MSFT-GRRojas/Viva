# Reopen or extend a Viva Glint survey cycle

Sometimes survey takers may need extra time to complete a survey or your response rate may not be as high as you hoped. Admins can reopen a survey cycle as long as a new cycle isn't started. The survey cycle can also be extended. 

>[!TIP]
>For best results, reopen a recently closed survey within a day or two of the survey cycle ending.

## Reopen a closed survey 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Survey close notifications aren't automatically regenerated once the original closing notification is sent. 

When a survey cycle is closed **and** the survey end notification email has sent, no further survey end notification email is sent.

Also consider:

- The Team Conversations for this survey is deleted and regenerated after the survey closes on the new date. Team Conversations isn't available while the survey is reopened.
- The **Phased Access** user role can't access the results of this survey until the role is regranted access. 
- Review and reschedule any Nudges already set. They also aren't rescheduled automatically. 

## Extend a survey cycle that hasn't closed

When a survey cycle is extended *before* its original close date, the notification generation automatically updates to reflect the new close date. The default for the survey end notification email is three days post survey cycle close.
>
> Example:
>
> - The survey end date is March 10. The survey end notification email is set to send on March 13.
> - On March 8, you extend the close date to March 15. The survey close notification automatically moves to March 18.

## Procedure for reopening or extending a survey 

1. Select the **Configuration** symbol on your admin dashboard (landing page).
2. Select **Survey Programs**.
3. In the **Survey Cycles** section, toggle to the **Completed** tab.

6. Select a new **Close date** for your survey.

> [!NOTE]
> A survey extension can't close *past the start date of the next scheduled survey.* If you choose an invalid date, you see a message directing you to choose a different date.

7. Select **Save.** The survey is immediately reopened and closes at midnight (11:59PM) on the selected date in the client's time zone. The survey status is now **Live**.
