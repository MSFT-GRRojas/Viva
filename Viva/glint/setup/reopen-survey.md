# Reopen or extend a Viva Glint survey cycle

Sometimes survey takers may need extra time to complete a survey or your response rate may not be as high as you hoped. Admins can reopen a survey cycle as long as a new cycle hasn't started. The survey cycle can also be extended. 

>[!TIP]
>For best results, reopen a recently closed survey within a day or two of the survey cycle ending.

## Reopen a closed survey 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Survey close notifications aren't automatically regenerated once the original closing notification is sent. 

When a survey is closed **and** notification emails have already been sent, the admin needs to manually set new notification dates. Reset new communications in the **Communications** section of **Program Summary**. 

Also consider:

- The Team Conversations for this survey is deleted and regenerated after the survey closes on the new date. Team Conversations is not available while the survey is reopened.
- The **Phased Access** user role can't access the results of this survey until the role is regranted access. 
- Review and reschedule any Nudges already set. They also aren't rescheduled automatically. 

## Extend a survey that hasn't closed

When a survey is extended before its close date - the survey close notification has not been sent - the notification generation automatically updates. The default for survey close notifications is three days post survey close.
>
>Example:
>
> - The survey close date is March 10. The survey close notification is set to send on March 13.
> - On March 8, you extend the close date to March 15. The survey close notification automatically moves to March 18.

## Procedure for reopening or extending a survey 

1. Select the **Configuration** symbol on your admin dashboard (landing page).
2. Select **Survey Programs**.
3. In the **Survey Cycles** section, toggle to the **Completed** tab.
4. From the horizontal elipses in the program bar, select **Reopen Survey**.

> [!NOTE]
> A survey extension can't close *past the start date of the next scheduled survey.* If you choose an invalid date, you see a message directing you to choose a different date.

7. Select **Save.** The survey is immediately reopened and closes at midnight (11:59PM) on the selected date in the client's time zone. The survey status is now **Live**.
