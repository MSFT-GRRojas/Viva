# 360 Viva Glint feedback program - feedback provider experience

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available beginning on 8/24/2024.

Feedback providers receive an email invitation to provide feedback. Selecting the button from the email opens a browser window with the survey. After the feedback provider submits their feedback, a Thank You page confirms theyâ€™ve completed their task.
After a feedback provider gives feedback, responses can't be edited.

>[!Note]
> Feedback providers can be added by subjects or 360 admins until the cycle closes for the subject. Subjects can only be added by 360 admins until the feedback provider selection end date for the cycle.
