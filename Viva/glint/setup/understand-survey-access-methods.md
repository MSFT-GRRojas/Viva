# Understand Viva Glint survey access methods

Microsoft Viva Glint offers multiple survey access methods that can be used independently or in combination to meet the needs of your employee population. Admins can set up combined access methods with:

- Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID and attribute-based access
- Personalized survey links and attribute-based access

> [!NOTE] 
> Admins can't combine authentication with Microsoft Entra ID and personalized survey links in Viva Glint as a combined access method. The link behind the **Provide Feedback** button in survey emails has to use authentication with Microsoft Entra ID **or** personalized survey links.

Viva Glint recommends that admins enable the requirement for users to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID as the most secure method to administer surveys. This access method also allows for participation in integrations across other Viva applications.

> [!NOTE] 
> Personalized links and attribute-based access aren't currently available access methods for [Viva Glint 360 feedback programs](360-overview.md). Participants in 360 feedback (raters, feedback providers, admins) must acess 360s with authentication via Microsoft Entra ID. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Survey access with authentication via Entra and personalized survey links send email invites and reminders with the correct links for survey access. Admins can't copy links from the Viva Glint platform to share with users as a survey access method.

## Set up survey access that requires authentication with Microsoft Entra ID
Use this guidance to enable survey invite links that require authentication with Microsoft Entra ID. Grant all users access to the Viva Glint **My Surveys** tab so that participants can access their surveys. After selecting the Provide Feedback button in survey emails, users with one active survey go directly to the survey landing page after authentication. Users with multiple active surveys land on the My Surveys tab to select a survey.

### To enable this survey access method:

1. Work with your Viva Glint Global administrator to [establish access to Viva Glint via Microsoft Entra ID.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2238425)
1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol, then in **Client Settings**, choose **General Settings**.
3. In the **All Settings** menu, select **Engage Survey Details**.
4. Switch the **Require Azure AD for links in survey emails** setting to **Yes**.
5. Select **Save Changes** in the top right of the **General Settings** page.

### To grant all users access to the My Surveys tab in Viva Glint:

1. Select the **Configuration** symbol, then in **Employees** , choose **User Roles**.
2. Select **+ New Role** and give your new User Role name in the top left. For example: Entra Survey Access Users.
3. In **Permissions**, select the **View My Surveys** checkbox, then in the top right of the **Permissions and Access** page, select **Save Changes**.
4. In the **All Members** section of the role, select **Add/Edit Employees** and then choose **Attribute Rules.**
5. In the setup pane, select the **I want to include all active employees only** option and select **Save Changes.**
   1. To enable the **Save Changes** selection, make a small edit and undo. For example, select the **Include Inactive Employees** checkbox and then unselect.

## Use a personalized survey link

When the **Require Azure AD for links in survey emails** setting in **General Settings** is set to **No**, personalized links are the survey access method for users. Survey emails contain a personalized survey link that is tied to each participant and shouldn't be forwarded. When users select this personalized link, they access an active survey with no authentication.

## Set up attribute-based survey access

Viva Glint's attribute-based survey access allows users without a work email account to complete surveys in another way. Users enter two unique pieces of employee information rather than authenticating in Viva Glint through an email invite. Admins can convert the survey link into a QR code or shortened link to share with frontline workers. To set up attribute-based survey access, follow the guidance in this article: [Set up attribute-based survey access in Viva Glint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230745).

## Survey session time-outs

Depending on the survey access method that your organization selects, users are prompted to continue their session and have their sessions ended after different periods of inactivity.

|Survey access method   |Are you still here? prompt   |Session ends|
|:----------|:-----------|:------------|
|Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID     |After 20 minutes of inactivity       |After another 10 minutes of inactivity        |
|Personalized link |After 20 minutes of inactivity    |After another 10 minutes of inactivity |
|Attribute-based access |After 30 seconds of inactivity   |After another 30 seconds of inactivity|

## Survey participant experiences

Viva Glint survey access methods present different user experiences depending on the method admins select and how many active surveys a user is included in.

### Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

- **Survey access:** Users (managers with report access or individual contributors) select the **Provide Feedback** button in survey invites and reminders.
- **Landing page:**
  - If the user is included in **multiple active surveys**, they're taken to the **My Surveys** tab in Viva Glint.
  - If the user has **one (1) active survey**, they're taken directly to the survey welcome page.

> [!NOTE] 
> If admins or managers access the Viva Glint application with a dashboard link during a live survey (not with a link in an invite or reminder email), they'll go to their dashboards. Users can access live surveys by going to the **My Surveys** tab.

### Personalized link

- **Survey access:** Users (managers with report access or individual contributors) select the **Provide Feedback** button in survey invites and reminders.
- **Landing page:** Users are taken directly to the survey welcome page, regardless of their number of active surveys. The personalized link is specific to each user and each survey.

### Attribute-based access

- **Survey access:** Users (managers with report access or individual contributors) access the attribute-based access survey link shared by their organization. Admins can convert this link a shortened version or a QR code for easy access by deskless workers.
- **Landing page:** Users go to an access page that prompts them to enter two (2) pieces of information (for example, employee ID and email address). After users enter correct information, they go to the survey welcome page.
