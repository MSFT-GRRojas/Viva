# Delete survey data from Viva Glint

As your company’s data controller, Microsoft Viva Glint admins can delete nonactive surveys data. This action deletes every data entity directly related to the survey, including overall survey configuration, items/questions, reports, responses, etc.
The action won’t delete distribution lists or any roles related with the survey. 

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Glint admins must have Advanced Configuration access enabled to delete survey data.

> [!CAUTION]
> Survey data deletion in Glint is an irreversible process. Perform this action only when confident that the data of the survey is not required anymore. 

## Survey data can be deleted from Surveys Programs on the admin configuration dashboard 
To delete survey data from Glint, follow this process:
1.	Select **Survey Programs** from your admin **Configuration** page. 
1.	Use the search box or navigate over the **Survey Programs** list to identify the survey that data should be deleted from. 
1.	Select the three dots and then from the dropdown menu, choose **Delete**.
1.	A **Survey Delete** confirmation box asks for confirmation and displays the following message: “This will permanently delete all data associated with this program.”
1.	If you aren't sure if they should complete the action, select **No, I am not sure**, otherwise **confirm the action**. 
1.	Once the delete action is completed, return to the Survey page to verify that the survey doesn't appear in the Survey Programs list.
