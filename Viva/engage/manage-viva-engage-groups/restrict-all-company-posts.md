# Restrict All Company posts in Viva Engage

Organizations that want to curate conversations in the Viva Engage All Company community can now restrict posting. All Company admins can initiate the conversations, while employees in All Company can respond and react to conversation starters.

Restricted posting applies only to All Company communities and is supported with the Microsoft Teams Communities app integration and the Microsoft Outlook integration.  

Restrict All Company conversation posts (All Company admins only)
To restrict who can post in All Company, an All Company admin needs to set the following in All Company:

1. In **All Company**, select the **More options** icon, and then select **Settings**.

1. Under **Posting Permissions**, select **Restricted: Only admins can start a conversation in this community**. All members can comment and reply to a comment.

After you've selected this option, non-admins won't see the option to post in All Company.

>[!NOTE]
>If you run a live event in a post-restricted All Company community, questions and comments from the live event will appear in the community feed. (Live events are only available in Microsoft 365 connected All Company communities.) For more information about how connected groups work, see [Viva Engage and Microsoft 365 Groups](/viva/engage/engage-microsoft-365-groups).

## What non-admin employees see in All Company

When All Company is set to Restricted, non-admins can't post conversation starters in All Company. They either see that All Company is Restricted or that 'Only admins can start a conversation.'

All employees can respond to conversation starters and reactions.

If a user tries to post using email when All Company is restricted, the email won't post to All Company. Only All Company admins can post by using Outlook, although anyone can reply by using Outlook.

## Restricting posting in an embedded feed

Restricting posts in All Company is supported with the SharePoint Conversations V2 web part. This is the only web part or embed feature that supports post restriction in All Company.

For details about the SharePoint Conversations V2 web part, see [Use a Viva Engage web part in SharePoint Online](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-a-viva-engage-web-part-in-sharepoint-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).
